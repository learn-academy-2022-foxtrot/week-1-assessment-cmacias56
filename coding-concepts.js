// ASSESSMENT 1: Coding Conceptual Questions

// Examine the following examples.

// First, predict the outcome based on your understanding of the code.
// Then, uncomment the console.log() and verify the output. Briefly explain why your initial answer was correct or incorrect.

// --------------------INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What will this log?
//const colors = ["tangerine", "magenta", "lilac", "daffodil"]
 //console.log(colors.push("indigo"))

// a) Your answer: value of 5 will produce

// a) Your answer: value of 10 will produce
// b) Verify and explain: 10 is correct, .length will give the amount of every charater including space


// --------------------2) What will this log?

//const greeting = "Hello World!"

// b) Verify and explain: the letter o produced, the 4 indicated the o in hello based on 0-4 array. H-0 E-1 L-2 L-3 O-4


// --------------------3) What will this log?

//const languages = ["JavaScript", "Ruby", "Python", "C++"]
//const index = 1
// console.log(languages[index])

// a) Your answer: ruby will produce
// b) Verify and explain: ruby was produced, elements list from 0,1,2,3. Javascript - 0, ruby -1, python - 2, c++ - 3


// --------------------4) What will this log?

//const weekendDays = ["saturday", "sunday"]
// console.log(weekendDays.toUpperCase())

// a) Your answer: toUppercase is not a variable and does not have a function. 
// b) Verify and explain: correct. code did not provide any function to toUpperCase, it is not a variable. 


// --------------------5) What will this log?

//const dataTypes = ["number", "string", "Boolean"]
// console.log(typeof dataTypes.length)

// a) Your answer: 3
// b) Verify and explain: number, the operator typeof was forgien to me, after looking on w3schools I found the operator described the answer or only listed one portion of the string. I plan to look into this alot more.
